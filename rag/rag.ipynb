They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable—meaning it cannot  be altered.\\n\\nSince a block can’t be changed, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This reduces the need for trusted third parties, such as auditors or other humans, who add costs and can make mistakes.\\n\\nYou might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. The key difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.\\n\\nA blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: entering and accessing information, and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.\\n\\nThe Bitcoin blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a 4MB file called a block (different blockchains have different size blocks). Once the block is full, the block data is run through a cryptographic hash function, which creates a hexadecimal number called the block header hash.\\n\\nThe hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in that block's header, creating a chain of blocks, hence the name “blockchain.”\\n\\n\")]"

We also lay out possible future\\ntrends for blockchain.\\nIndex T erms—Blockchain, decentralization, consensus, scala-\\nbility\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nNowadays cryptocurrency has become a buzzword in both\\nindustry and academia. As one of the most successful cryp-\\ntocurrency, Bitcoin has enjoyed a huge success with its capital\\nmarket reaching 10 billion dollars in 2016 [1]. With a spe-\\ncially designed data storage structure, transactions in Bitcoin\\nnetwork could happen without any third party and the core\\ntechnology to build Bitcoin is blockchain, which was ﬁrst\\nproposed in 2008 and implemented in 2009 [2]. Blockchain\\ncould be regarded as a public ledger and all committed\\ntransactions are stored in a list of blocks. This chain grows\\nas new blocks are appended to it continuously. Asymmetric\\ncryptography and distributed consensus algorithms have been\\nimplemented for user security and ledger consistency. The\\nblockchain technology generally has key characteristics of\\ndecentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. With\\nthese traits, blockchain can greatly save the cost and improve\\nthe efﬁciency.\\nSince it allows payment to be ﬁnished without any bank or\\nany intermediary, blockchain can be used in various ﬁnancial\\nservices such as digital assets, remittance and online payment\\n[3], [4]. Additionally, it can also be applied into other ﬁelds\\nincluding smart contracts [5], public services [6], Internet of\\nThings (IoT) [7], reputation systems [8] and security services\\n[9]. Those ﬁelds favor blockchain in multiple ways. First of all,\\nblockchain is immutable. Transaction cannot be tampered once\\nit is packed into the blockchain. Businesses that require high\\nreliability and honesty can use blockchain to attract customers.\\nBesides, blockchain is distributed and can avoid the single\\npoint of failure situation. As for smart contracts, the contract\\ncould be executed by miners automatically once the contract\\nhas been deployed on the blockchain.\\nAlthough the blockchain technology has great potential for\\nthe construction of the future Internet systems, it is facing a\\nnumber of technical challenges. Firstly, scalability is a huge\\nconcern. Bitcoin block size is limited to 1 MB now while\\na block is mined about every ten minutes. Subsequently, the\\nBitcoin network is restricted to a rate of 7 transactions per\\nsecond, which is incapable of dealing with high frequency\\ntrading. However, larger blocks means larger storage space\\nand slower propagation in the network. This will lead to\\ncentralization gradually as less users would like to maintain\\nsuch a large blockchain. Therefore the tradeoff between block\\nsize and security has been a tough challenge. Secondly, it has\\nbeen proved that miners could achieve larger revenue than\\ntheir fair share through selﬁsh mining strategy [10]. Miners\\nhide their mined blocks for more revenue in the future. In\\nthat way, branches could take place frequently, which hinders\\nblockchain development. Hence some solutions need to be put\\nforward to ﬁx this problem. Moreover, it has been shown that\\nprivacy leakage could also happen in blockchain even users\\nonly make transactions with their public key and private key\\n[11]. Furthermore, current consensus algorithms likeproof of\\nwork or proof of stakeare facing some serious problems. For\\nexample, proof of work wastes too much electricity energy\\nwhile the phenomenon that the rich get richer could appear in\\nthe proof of stake consensus process.\\nThere is a lot of literature on blockchain from various\\nsources, such as blogs, wikis, forum posts, codes, confer-\\nence proceedings and journal articles.

Figure 1 illustrates an example of a blockchain. With\\na previous block hash contained in the block header, a block\\nhas only oneparent block. It is worth noting thatuncle blocks\\n(children of the block’s ancestors) hashes would also be stored\\nin ethereum blockchain [15]. The ﬁrst block of a blockchain\\nis called genesis block which has no parent block. We then\\nexplain the internals of blockchain in details.\\nA. Block\\nA block consists of theblock headerand the block bodyas\\nshown in Figure 2. In particular, the block header includes:\\n(i) Block version: indicates which set of block validation\\nrules to follow.\\n(ii) Merkle tree root hash: the hash value of all the transac-\\ntions in the block.\\n(iii) Timestamp: current time as seconds in universal time\\nsince January 1, 1970.\\n(iv) nBits: target threshold of a valid block hash.\\n(v) Nonce: an 4-byte ﬁeld, which usually starts with 0\\nand increases for every hash calculation (will be explained\\nin details in Section III).\\n(vi) Parent block hash: a 256-bit hash value that points to\\nthe previous block.\\nThe block body is composed of a transaction counter and\\ntransactions. The maximum number of transactions that a\\nblock can contain depends on the block size and the size of\\neach transaction. Blockchain uses an asymmetric cryptography\\nmechanism to validate the authentication of transactions [13].\\nDigital signature based on asymmetric cryptography is used in\\nan untrustworthy environment. We next brieﬂy illustrate digital\\nsignature.\\nB. Digital Signature\\nEach user owns a pair of private key and public key.\\nThe private key that shall be kept in conﬁdentiality is used\\nto sign the transactions. The digital signed transactions are\\nbroadcasted throughout the whole network. The typical digital\\nsignature is involved with two phases: signing phase and\\nveriﬁcation phase. For instance, an user Alice wants to send\\nanother user Bob a message. (1) In the signing phase, Alice\\nencrypts her data with her private key and sends Bob the\\nencrypted result and original data. (2) In the veriﬁcation phase,\\nBob validates the value with Alice’s public key. In that way,\\nBob could easily check if the data has been tampered or not.\\nThe typical digital signature algorithm used in blockchains is\\nthe elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) [16].\\nC. Key Characteristics of Blockchain\\nIn summary, blockchain has following key characteristics.\\n• Decentralization. In conventional centralized transaction\\nsystems, each transaction needs to be validated through\\nthe central trusted agency (e.g., the central bank), in-\\nevitably resulting to the cost and the performance bottle-\\nnecks at the central servers. Contrast to the centralized\\nmode, third party is no longer needed in blockchain.\\nConsensus algorithms in blockchain are used to maintain\\ndata consistency in distributed network.\\n• Persistency. Transactions can be validated quickly and\\ninvalid transactions would not be admitted by honest\\nminers. It is nearly impossible to delete or rollback\\ntransactions once they are included in the blockchain.\\nBlocks that contain invalid transactions could be discov-\\nered immediately.\\n• Anonymity. Each user can interact with the blockchain\\nwith a generated address, which does not reveal the\\nreal identity of the user. Note that blockchain cannot\\nguarantee the perfect privacy preservation due to the\\nintrinsic constraint (details will be discussed in section\\nIV).\\n558'),\n",

Bitcoin blockchain stores data about user\\nbalances based on the Unspent Transaction Output (UTX-\\nO) model [2]: Any transaction has to refer to some previ-\\nous unspent transactions. Once the current transaction is\\nrecorded into the blockchain, the state of those referred\\nunspent transactions switch from unspent to spent. So\\ntransactions could be easily veriﬁed and tracked.\\nD. Taxonomy of blockchain systems\\nCurrent blockchain systems are categorized roughly into\\nthree types: public blockchain, private blockchain and con-\\nsortium blockchain [17]. In public blockchain, all records are\\nvisible to the public and everyone could take part in the con-\\nsensus process. Differently, only a group of pre-selected nodes\\nwould participate in the consensus process of a consortium\\nblockchain. As for private blockchain, only those nodes that\\ncome from one speciﬁc organization would be allowed to join\\nthe consensus process.\\nA private blockchain is regarded as a centralized network\\nsince it is fully controlled by one organization. The consortium\\nblockchain constructed by several organizations is partially\\ndecentralized since only a small portion of nodes would be\\nselected to determine the consensus. The comparison among\\nthe three types of blockchains is listed in Table I.\\n• Consensus determination. In public blockchain, each n-\\node could take part in the consensus process. And only\\na selected set of nodes are responsible for validating the\\nblock in consortium blockchain. As for private chain, it is\\nfully controlled by one organization and the organization\\ncould determine the ﬁnal consensus.\\n• Read permission. Transactions in a public blockchain are\\nvisible to the public while it depends when it comes to a\\nprivate blockchain or a consortium blockchain.\\n• Immutability. Since records are stored on a large number\\nof participants, it is nearly impossible to tamper trans-\\nactions in a public blockchain. Differently, transactions\\nin a private blockchain or a consortium blockchain could\\nbe tampered easily as there are only limited number of\\nparticipants.\\n• Efﬁciency. It takes plenty of time to propagate transac-\\ntions and blocks as there are a large number of nodes\\non public blockchain network. As a result, transaction\\nthroughput is limited and the latency is high. With fewer\\nvalidators, consortium blockchain and private blockchain\\ncould be more efﬁcient.\\n• Centralized. The main difference among the three types\\nof blockchains is that public blockchain is decentralized,\\nconsortium blockchain is partially centralized and private\\nblockchain is fully centralized as it is controlled by a\\nsingle group.\\n• Consensus process. Everyone in the world could join\\nthe consensus process of the public blockchain. Different\\nfrom public blockchain, both consortium blockchain and\\nprivate blockchain are permissioned.\\nSince public blockchain is open to the world, it can at-\\ntract many users and communities are active. Many public\\nblockchains emerge day by day. As for consortium blockchain,\\nit could be applied into many business applications. Cur-\\nrently Hyperledger [18] is developing business consortium\\nblockchain frameworks. Ethereum also has provided tools for\\nbuilding consortium blockchains [19].\\nIII. C ONSENSUS ALGORITHMS\\nIn blockchain, how to reach consensus among the untrust-\\nworthy nodes is a transformation of the Byzantine Generals\\n(BG) Problem, which was raised in [20]. In BG problem,\\na group of generals who command a portion of Byzantine\\narmy circle the city. Some generals prefer to attack while\\nother generals prefer to retreat. However, the attack would\\nfail if only part of the generals attack the city. Thus, they\\nhave to reach an agreement to attack or retreat. How to reach\\na consensus in distributed environment is a challenge. It is\\nalso a challenge for blockchain as the blockchain network\\nis distributed. In blockchain, there is no central node that\\nensures ledgers on distributed nodes are all the same. Some\\nprotocols are needed to ensure ledgers in different nodes are\\nconsistent. We next present several common approaches to\\nreach a consensus in blockchain.\\nA. Approaches to consensus\\nPoW (Proof of work) is a consensus strategy used in the\\nBitcoin network [2]. In a decentralized network, someone has\\nto be selected to record the transactions. The easiest way is\\nrandom selection. However, random selection is vulnerable to\\nattacks. So if a node wants to publish a block of transactions, a\\nlot of work has to be done to prove that the node is not likely\\nto attack the network. Generally the work means computer\\n559'),\n",

In PoW, each node of the network is calculating\\na hash value of the block header. The block header contains\\na nonce and miners would change the nonce frequently to\\nget different hash values. The consensus requires that the\\ncalculated value must be equal to or smaller than a certain\\ngiven value. When one node reaches the target value, it would\\nbroadcast the block to other nodes and all other nodes must\\nmutually conﬁrm the correctness of the hash value. If the block\\nis validated, other miners would append this new block to\\ntheir own blockchains. Nodes that calculate the hash values\\nare called miners and the PoW procedure is calledmining in\\nBitcoin.\\nIn the decentralized network, valid blocks might be gen-\\nerated simultaneously when multiple nodes ﬁnd the suitable\\nnonce nearly at the same time. As a result, branches may be\\ngenerated as shown in Figure 3. However, it is unlikely that\\ntwo competing forks will generate next block simultaneously.\\nIn PoW protocol, a chain that becomes longer thereafter is\\njudged as the authentic one. Consider two forks created by\\nsimultaneously validated blocks U4 and B4. Miners keep\\nmining their blocks until a longer branch is found. B4,B5\\nforms a longer chain, so the miners on U4 would switch to\\nthe longer branch.\\nMiners have to do a lot of computer calculations in PoW,\\nyet these works waste too much resources. To mitigate the\\nloss, some PoW protocols in which works could have some\\nside-applications have been designed. For example, Primecoin\\n[25] searches for special prime number chains which can be\\nused for mathematical research.\\nPoS (Proof of stake) is an energy-saving alternative to PoW.\\nMiners in PoS have to prove the ownership of the amount\\nof currency. It is believed that people with more currencies\\nwould be less likely to attack the network. The selection\\nbased on account balance is quite unfair because the single\\nrichest person is bound to be dominant in the network. As a\\nresult, many solutions are proposed with the combination of\\nthe stake size to decide which one to forge the next block.\\nIn particular, Blackcoin [26] uses randomization to predict the\\nnext generator. It uses a formula that looks for the lowest\\nhash value in combination with the size of the stake. Peercoin\\n[21] favors coin age based selection. In Peercoin, older and\\nlarger sets of coins have a greater probability of mining the\\nnext block. Compared to PoW, PoS saves more energy and\\nis more effective. Unfortunately, as the mining cost is nearly\\nzero, attacks might come as a consequence. Many blockchains\\nadopt PoW at the beginning and transform to PoS gradually.\\nFor instance, ethereum is planing to move from Ethash (a kind\\nof PoW) [27] to Casper (a kind of PoS) [28].\\nPBFT (Practical byzantine fault tolerance) is a replication\\nalgorithm to tolerate byzantine faults [29]. Hyperledger Fabric\\n[18] utilizes the PBFT as its consensus algorithm since PBFT\\ncould handle up to 1/3 malicious byzantine replicas. A new\\nblock is determined in a round. In each round, a primary would\\nbe selected according to some rules. And it is responsible for\\nordering the transaction. The whole process could be divided\\ninto three phase:pre-prepared, prepared and commit. In each\\nphase, a node would enter next phase if it has received votes\\nfrom over 2/3 of all nodes. So PBFT requires that every\\nnode is known to the network. Like PBFT, Stellar Consensus\\nProtocol (SCP) [30] is also a Byzantine agreement protocol.\\nIn PBFT, each node has to query other nodes while SCP gives\\nparticipants the right to choose which set of other participants\\nto believe. Based on PBFT, Antshares [31] has implemented\\ntheir dBFT (delegated byzantine fault tolerance). In dBFT,\\nsome professional nodes are voted to record the transactions.\\nDPOS (Delegated proof of stake). The major difference\\nbetween PoS and DPOS is that PoS is direct democratic while\\nDPOS is representative democratic. Stakeholders elect their\\ndelegates to generate and validate blocks. With signiﬁcantly\\nfewer nodes to validate the block, the block could be conﬁrmed\\nquickly, leading to the quick conﬁrmation of transactions.\\nMeanwhile, the parameters of the network such asblock size\\nand block intervalscould be tuned by delegates.

DPOS is the backbone of Bitshares\\n[22].\\nRipple [23] is a consensus algorithm that utilizes\\ncollectively-trusted subnetworks within the larger network. In\\nthe network, nodes are divided into two types: server for\\nparticipating consensus process andclient for only transferring\\nfunds. Each server has an Unique Node List (UNL). UNL is\\nimportant to the server. When determining whether to put a\\ntransaction into the ledger, the server would query the nodes\\nin UNL and if the received agreements have reached 80%, the\\ntransaction would be packed into the ledger. For a node, the\\nledger will remain correct as long as the percentage of faulty\\nnodes in UNL is less than 20%.\\nT endermint[24] is a byzantine consensus algorithm. A new\\nblock is determined in a round. A proposer would be selected\\nto broadcast an unconﬁrmed block in this round. It could be\\ndivided into three steps: 1) Prevote step. V alidators choose\\nwhether to broadcast a prevote for the proposed block. 2)\\nPrecommit step. If the node has received more than 2/3 of\\nprevotes on the proposed block, it broadcasts a precommit for\\nthat block. If the node has received over 2/3 of precommits,\\nit enters the commit step. 3)Commit step. The node validates\\nthe block and broadcasts a commit for that block. if the\\nnode has received 2/3 of the commits, it accepts the block.\\nContrast to PBFT, nodes have to lock their coins to become\\nvalidators. Once a validator is found to be dishonest, it would\\nbe punished.\\nB. Consensus algorithms comparison\\nDifferent consensus algorithms have different advantages\\nand disadvantages. Table II gives a comparison between d-\\nifferent consensus algorithms and we use the properties given\\nby [32].\\n• Node identity management. PBFT needs to know the\\nidentity of each miner in order to select a primary in every\\nround while Tendermint needs to know the validators in\\norder to select a proposer in each round. For PoW, PoS,\\nDPOS and Ripple, nodes could join the network freely.\\n• Energy saving. In PoW, miners hash the block header\\ncontinuously to reach the target value. As a result, the\\namount of electricity required to process has reach an\\nimmense scale. As for PoS and DPOS, miners still have\\nto hash the block header to search the target value but\\nthe work has been largely reduced as the search space\\nis designed to be limited. As for PBFT, Ripple and\\nTendermint, there is no mining in consensus process. So\\nit saves energy greatly.\\n• Tolerated power of adversary. Generally 51% of hash\\npower is regarded as the threshold for one to gain control\\nof the network. But selﬁsh mining strategy [10] in PoW\\nsystems could help miners to gain more revenue by only\\n25% of the hashing power. PBFT and Tendermint is\\ndesigned to handle up to 1/3 faulty nodes. Ripple is\\nproved to maintain correctness if the faulty nodes in an\\nUNL is less than 20%.\\n• Example. Bitcoin is based on PoW while Peercoin is\\na new peer-to-peer PoS cryptocurrency. Further, Hyper-\\nledger Fabric utilizes PBFT to reach consensus. Bitshares,\\na smart contract platform, adopts DPOS as their con-\\nsensus algorithm. Ripple implements the Ripple protocol\\nwhile Tendermint devises the Tendermint protocol.\\nPBFT and Tendermint are permissioned protocols. Node\\nidentities are expected to be known to the whole network,\\nso they might be used in commercial mode rather than public.\\nPoW and PoS are suitable for public blockchain. Consortium\\nor private blockchain might has preference for PBFT, Tender-\\nmint, DPOS and Ripple.\\nC. Advances on consensus algorithms\\nA good consensus algorithm means efﬁciency, safty and\\nconvenience. Recently, a number of endeavors have been made\\nto improve consensus algorithms in blockchain. New con-\\nsensus algorithms are devised aiming to solve some speciﬁc\\nproblems of blockchain. The main idea of PeerCensus [33] is\\nto decouple block creation and transaction conﬁrmation so that\\nthe consensus speed can be signiﬁcantly increased. Besides,\\nKraft [34] proposed a new consensus method to ensure that\\na block is generated in a relatively stable speed. It is known\\nthat high blocks generation rate compromise Bitcoin’s security.\\nSo the Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree (GHOST) chain\\nselection rule [35] is proposed to solve this problem. Instead\\nof the longest branch scheme, GHOST weights the branches\\nand miners could choose the better one to follow. Chepurnoy\\net al. [36] presented a new consensus algorithm for peer-to-\\npeer blockchain systems where anyone who provides non-\\ninteractive proofs of retrievability for the past state snapshots\\nis agreed to generate the block. In such a protocol, miners\\nonly have to store old block headers instead of full blocks.\\nIV . CHALLENGES &R ECENT ADV ANCES\\nDespite the great potential of blockchain, it faces numerous\\nchallenges, which limit the wide usage of blockchain. We\\nenumerate some major challenges and recent advances as\\nfollows.\\nA. Scalability\\nWith the amount of transactions increasing day by day,\\nthe blockchain becomes bulky. Each node has to store all\\ntransactions to validate them on the blockchain because they\\nhave to check if the source of the current transaction is unspent\\nor not. Besides, due to the original restriction of block size and\\nthe time interval used to generate a new block, the Bitcoin\\nblockchain can only process nearly 7 transactions per second,\\nwhich cannot fulﬁll the requirement of processing millions of\\ntransactions in real-time fashion. Meanwhile, as the capacity of\\nblocks is very small, many small transactions might be delayed\\nsince miners prefer those transactions with high transaction\\nfee.\\nThere are a number of efforts proposed to address the\\nscalability problem of blockchain, which could be categorized\\ninto two types:\\n561'),\n",

Since it is harder for\\nnode to operate full copy of ledger, Bruce proposed a\\nnovel cryptocurrency scheme, in which the old transaction\\nrecords are removed (or forgotten) by the network [37].\\nA database named account tree is used to hold the\\nbalance of all non-empty addresses. Besides lightweight\\nclient could also help ﬁx this problem. A novel schem\\nnamed V erSum [38] was proposed to provide another\\nway allowing lightweight clients to exist. V erSum allows\\nlightweight clients to outsource expensive computations\\nover large inputs. It ensures the computation result is\\ncorrect through comparing results from multiple servers.\\n• Redesigning blockchain. In [39], Bitcoin-NG (Next Gen-\\neration) was proposed. The main idea of Bitcoin-NG is\\nto decouple conventional block into two parts: key block\\nfor leader election and microblock to store transactions.\\nThe protocol divides time into epoches. In each epoch,\\nminers have to hash to generate a key block. Once the key\\nblock is generated, the node becomes the leader who is\\nresponsible for generating microblocks. Bitcoin-NG also\\nextended the heaviest (longest) chain strategy in which\\nmicroblocks carry no weight. In this way, blockchain\\nis redesigned and the tradeoff between block size and\\nnetwork security has been addressed.\\nB. Privacy Leakage\\nBlockchain can preserve a certain amount of privacy through\\nthe public key and private key. Users transact with their\\nprivate key and public key without any real identity exposure.\\nHowever, it is shown in [40], [5] that blockchain cannot\\nguarantee the transactional privacy since the values of all\\ntransactions and balances for each public key are publicly\\nvisible. Besides, the recent study [41] has shown that a user’s\\nBitcoin transactions can be linked to reveal user’s information.\\nMoreover, Biryukov et al. [11] presented an method to link\\nuser pseudonyms to IP addresses even when users are behind\\nNetwork Address Translation (NA T) or ﬁrewalls. In [11], each\\nclient can be uniquely identiﬁed by a set of nodes it connects\\nto. However, this set can be learned and used to ﬁnd the\\norigin of a transaction. Multiple methods have been proposed\\nto improve anonymity of blockchain, which could be roughly\\ncategorized into two types:\\n• Mixing [42]. In blockchain, users addresses are pseudony-\\nmous. But it is still possible to link addresses to user real\\nidentity as many users make transactions with the same\\naddress frequently. Mixing service is a kind of service\\nwhich provides anonymity by transferring funds from\\nmultiple input addresses to multiple output addresses. For\\nexample, user Alice with address A wants to send some\\nfunds to Bob with address B. If Alice directly makes a\\ntransaction with input address A and output address B,\\nrelationship between Alice and Bob might be revealed. So\\nAlice could send funds to a trusted intermediary Carol.\\nThen Carol transfer funds to Bob with multiple inputs c1,\\nc2, c3, etc., and multiple output d1, d2, B, d3, etc. Bob’s\\naddress B is also contained in the output addresses. So it\\nbecomes harder to reveal relationship between Alice and\\nBob. However, the intermediary could be dishonest and\\nreveal Alice and Bob’s private information on purpose.\\nIt is also possible that Carol transfers Alice’s funds to\\nher own address instead of Bob’s address. Mixcoin [43]\\nprovides a simple method to avoid dishonest behaviours.\\nThe intermediary encrypts users’ requirements including\\nfunds amount and transfer date with its private key. Then\\nif the intermediary did not transfer the money, anybody\\ncould verify that the intermediary cheated. However, theft\\nis detected but still not prevented. Coinjoin [44] depends\\non a central mixing server to shufﬂe output addresses to\\nprevent theft. And inspired by Coinjoin, CoinShufﬂe [45]\\nuses decryption mixnets for address shufﬂing.\\n• Anonymous. In Zerocoin [46], zero-knowledge proof\\nis used. Miners do not have to validate a transaction\\nwith digital signature but to validate coins belong to\\na list of valid coins. Payment’s origin are unlinked\\nfrom transactions to prevent transaction graph analyses.\\nBut it still reveals payments’ destination and amounts.\\nZerocash [47] was proposed to address this problem.\\nIn Zerocash, zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive\\nArguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) is leveraged.\\nTransaction amounts and the values of coins held by users\\nare hidden.\\nC. Selﬁsh Mining\\nBlockchain is susceptible to attacks of colluding selﬁsh\\nminers. In particular, Eyal and Sirer [10] showed that the\\nnetwork is vulnerable even if only a small portion of the\\nhashing power is used to cheat. In selﬁsh mining strategy,\\nselﬁsh miners keep their mined blocks without broadcasting\\nand the private branch would be revealed to the public only\\nif some requirements are satisﬁed. As the private branch is\\nlonger than the current public chain, it would be admitted\\nby all miners. Before the private blockchain publishment,\\nhonest miners are wasting their resources on an useless branch\\nwhile selﬁsh miners are mining their private chain without\\ncompetitors. So selﬁsh miners tend to get more revenue.\\nBased on selﬁsh mining, many other attacks have been\\nproposed to show that blockchain is not so secure. In stubborn\\nmining [48], miners could amplify its gain by non-trivially\\ncomposing mining attacks with network-level eclipse attacks.\\nThe trail-stubbornness is one of the stubborn strategy that\\nminers still mine the blocks even if the private chain is left\\nbehind. Y et in some cases, it can result in 13% gains in\\ncomparison with a non-trail-stubborn counterpart. [49] shows\\nthat there are selﬁsh mining strategies that earn more money\\nand are proﬁtable for smaller miners compared to simple\\nselﬁsh mining. But the gains are relatively small. Furthermore,\\nit shows that attackers with less than 25% of the computational\\nresources can still gain from selﬁsh mining. To help ﬁx the\\nselﬁsh mining problem, Heilman [50] presented an novel\\napproach for honest miners to choose which branch to follow.\\nWith random beacons and timestamps, honest miners would\\nselect more fresh blocks. However, [50] is vulnerable to\\n562'),\n",

We discuss possible future directions with respect to four\\nareas: blockchain testing, stop the tendency to centralization,\\nbig data analyticsand blockchain application.\\nA. Blockchain testing\\nRecently different kinds of blockchains appear and over\\n700 cryptocurrencies are listed in [52] up to now. However,\\nsome developers might falsify their blockchain performance\\nto attract investors driven by the huge proﬁt. Besides that,\\nwhen users want to combine blockchain into business, they\\nhave to know which blockchain ﬁts their requirements. So\\nblockchain testing mechanism needs to be in place to test\\ndifferent blockchains.\\nBlockchain testing could be separated into two phases:\\nstandardization phase and testing phase. In standardization\\nphase, all criteria have to be made and agreed. When a\\nblockchain is born, it could be tested with the agreed criteria\\nto valid if the blockchain works ﬁne as developers claim. As\\nfor testing phase, blockchain testing needs to be performed\\nwith different criteria. For example, an user who is in charge\\nof online retail business cares about the throughput of the\\nblockchain, so the examination needs to test the average time\\nfrom a user send a transaction to the transaction is packed into\\nthe blockchain, capacity for a blockchain block and etc.\\nB. Stop the tendency to centralization\\nBlockchain is designed as a decentralized system. However,\\nthere is a trend that miners are centralized in the mining pool.\\nUp to now, the top 5 mining pools together owns larger than\\n51% of the total hash power in the Bitcoin network [53]. Apart\\nfrom that, selﬁsh mining strategy [10] showed that pools with\\nover 25% of total computing power could get more revenue\\nthan fair share. Rational miners would be attracted into the\\nselﬁsh pool and ﬁnally the pool could easily exceed 51% of\\nthe total power. As the blockchain is not intended to serve a\\nfew organizations, some methods should be proposed to solve\\nthis problem.\\nC. Big data analytics\\nBlockchain could be well combined with big data. Here\\nwe roughly categorized the combination into two types:data\\nmanagement and data analytics. As for data management,\\nblockchain could be used to store important data as it is\\ndistributed and secure. Blockchain could also ensure the data\\nis original. For example, if blockchain is used to store patients\\nhealth information, the information could not be tampered and\\nit is hard to stole those private information. When it comes to\\ndata analytics, transactions on blockchain could be used for\\nbig data analytics. For example, user trading patterns might\\nbe extracted. Users can predict their potential partners’ trading\\nbehaviours with the analysis.\\nD. Blockchain applications\\nCurrently most blockchains are used in the ﬁnancial domain,\\nmore and more applications for different ﬁelds are appearing.\\nTraditional industries could take blockchain into considera-\\ntion and apply blockchain into their ﬁelds to enhance their\\nsystems. For example, user reputations could be stored on\\nblockchain. At the same time, the up-and-coming industry\\ncould make use of blockchain to improve performance. For\\nexample, Arcade City [51], a ridesharing startup offers an\\nopen marketplace where riders connect directly with drivers\\nby leveraging blockchain technology.\\nA smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that\\nexecutes the terms of a contract [54]. It has been proposed\\nfor long time and now this concept can be implemented with\\nblockchain. In blockchain, smart contract is a code fragment\\nthat could be executed by miners automatically. Smart contract\\nhas transformative potential in various ﬁelds like ﬁnancial\\nservices and IoT.\\nVI. C ONCLUSION\\nBlockchain has shown its potential for transforming tradi-\\ntional industry with its key characteristics: decentralization,\\npersistency, anonymity and auditability. In this paper, we\\npresent a comprehensive overview on blockchain. We ﬁrst give\\nan overview of blockchain technologies including blockchain\\narchitecture and key characteristics of blockchain. We then dis-\\ncuss the typical consensus algorithms used in blockchain. We\\nanalyzed and compared these protocols in different respects.\\nFurthermore, we listed some challenges and problems that\\nwould hinder blockchain development and summarized some\\nexisting approaches for solving these problems. Some possible\\nfuture directions are also proposed. Nowadays blockchain-\\nbased applications are springing up and we plan to conduct\\nin-depth investigations on blockchain-based applications in the\\nfuture.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\nThe work described in this paper was supported by the\\nNational Key Research and Development Program (2016YF-\\nB1000101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China\\nunder (61472338), the Fundamental Research Funds for the\\nCentral Universities and Macao Science and Technology De-\\nvelopment Fund under Grant No. 096/2013/A3.
